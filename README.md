# Connect4

A very simple implementation of Connect4 in C++, built purely as a test bed.

## Local Development

### Prerequisites

* g++ 
* cmake

### Compiling

`make`

### Playing Connect4

An executable will be placed into the bin/ directory. 

`./bin/connect4`

## What's the point in this?

It's a test bed for me to try out things, things like:

* OpenGL
* Unity
* Networking
